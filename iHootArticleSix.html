        The VMAs; one of the most prestigious music events of the year. Sponsored by the famous tv channel from the 80-90s MTV. I watched the VMAs this year and it was very exciting. A lot of great and unique things happened! 
        <br>
         <br>
        
         I was very surprised to see that 53% of people who filled out the survey did not know what the VMAs were and of the 46.7% who knew about the VMAs, only 26% watched the VMAs. I interviewed a fellow classmate Orion Jean and he said that his favorite performance was Lizzo because of her unique background compared to other artists performing.

        My favorite performance at the VMAs was Blackpinkâ€™s unique K-pop performance. Blackpink also made history for being the first girl K-pop group to perform at the VMAs. I was also super excited that my favorite music artist Conan Gray was performing too!

        The VMAs is a very fun and action-packed event, I hope that one day I could go in person. I would definitely recommend you watch this show next year and maybe bring some friends to watch it with you!
